### Why You Should Never Assume You Have a Job

When you’re on the hunt for a job, it’s easy to get excited when things seem to be going well. Maybe you’ve had a great interview or received a positive email. But here's the straightforward truth: until you’re officially hired and have started working, nothing is set in stone. This post will walk you through why assuming you have a job too early can lead to disappointment and what you should do instead.

**1. The Importance of Finalizing Details**

Imagine you're baking a cake. You gather all the ingredients, mix them well, and place the batter in the oven. But if you don’t wait for it to bake completely, you won’t have a cake to eat. The job process is similar. Even if an employer says, "We’ll be in touch," it doesn’t mean you have the job. Often, this is just polite talk while they finalize their decisions. Wait for concrete steps, like a completed background check and an official start date, before celebrating. Think of these steps as the cake baking to perfection.

**2. Real Confirmation Comes with a Paycheck**

You know you truly have a job when you’ve worked and received your first paycheck. Until then, consider everything else as just talk. The job market can be tricky and competitive. Sometimes, companies change their minds, or unexpected issues arise. So, adopt the mindset of being pleasantly surprised when things work out, rather than expecting them to and getting disappointed. This approach helps you stay grounded and ready for the next opportunity, just like keeping your umbrella handy on a cloudy day.

**3. Stay Proactive and Keep Looking**

Until you are physically at your new desk, it’s wise to keep applying to other jobs. This keeps your options open and takes the pressure off any single opportunity. It’s like planting several seeds in a garden; some may not grow, but others will bloom beautifully. Reach out to people you know in the company if you’re waiting for updates. Many times, internal systems can be slow or even mess up records. A gentle nudge can sometimes make all the difference.

**How This Affects Real Life**

Understanding that a job isn’t yours until you’re officially hired can save you from a lot of stress and heartache. It encourages you to always have a plan B and keep your career options open. This way, if one opportunity doesn’t work out, you have others lined up. It’s all about staying prepared and flexible, like having a backup battery when your phone’s about to die. This proactive approach not only helps in job hunting but also in many other areas of life.

**Key Takeaways**

Never assume you have a job until everything is finalized and you’ve started working. Wait for official confirmation, like a start date and paycheck. Stay proactive by continuing your job search and reaching out to contacts. Keeping options open ensures you’re ready for whatever comes your way.
