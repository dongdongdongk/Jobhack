**Feeling Stuck with a Business Management Degree? You're Not Alone**

Finding a job after earning a degree in business management can be tough. You might feel frustrated, especially if you get turned down for jobs you think you’re overqualified for, like a position at a storage facility. You're not alone. Many people are feeling the pinch, even those with degrees and experience. Here’s a look at why this happens and what you can do about it.

**Why Am I Getting Rejected Despite My Qualifications?**

One reason you might be getting rejected is that employers think you’ll leave the job quickly. When they see a degree or a lot of experience on your resume, they might assume you’ll ask for higher pay or leave as soon as a better opportunity comes along. This can be frustrating, especially when you’re just looking to get started somewhere, anywhere.

**You’re Not Alone—It’s a Tough Job Market**

It’s important to know you’re not the only one struggling. People with degrees in marketing, management experience, and even those already working in their field are finding it hard to land jobs. The job market is challenging right now, and it’s affecting many job seekers. Knowing others are experiencing the same can be a small comfort and remind you that your struggles aren’t due to a lack of effort or ability.

**What Can You Do to Improve Your Chances?**

1. **Tailor Your Resume:** Make sure your resume is specific to each job you apply for. Highlight skills and experiences that match the job description.

2. **Consider Entry-Level Positions:** While it might feel like a step back, entry-level jobs can be a great way to get your foot in the door and prove your worth.

3. **Network:** Reach out to friends, family, or former colleagues. Sometimes a personal connection can help you find opportunities that aren’t advertised.

4. **Stay Positive:** Rejection can be tough, but try to stay positive and keep applying. Every "no" gets you closer to a "yes."

**In Conclusion**

Feeling stuck with a degree and no job to show for it can be disheartening, but remember that you’re not alone. The job market is tough for many people right now. Keep tailoring your resume, consider entry-level positions, and don’t underestimate the power of networking. Stay positive and persistent, and eventually, the right opportunity will come along.
