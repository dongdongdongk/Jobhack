### Why Gen Z is Choosing Trade Jobs Over Tech

Many young people, especially from Gen Z, are turning to trade jobs like HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) installation instead of tech careers. This might seem surprising in a world where technology is booming. However, there are solid reasons for this trend. As tech leaders predict that artificial intelligence (AI) will replace many jobs, it's clear that some roles, especially hands-on trades, are still safe from AI's reach. After all, AI can’t install an HVAC system or perform other skilled manual tasks.

### The Reality of AI in Jobs

While some claim that AI will eventually do all human jobs, there’s little proof to back this up. In factories with robotic systems, humans are still needed to fix machines when they break. So, jobs that require hands-on skills are not disappearing anytime soon. Many workers in trades have job security because AI can't yet replace the complex tasks they perform daily.

### The Appeal of Trade Jobs

Trade jobs offer several advantages. First, they provide a stable career path without needing a college degree, which saves time and money. Second, these jobs are essential in our everyday lives—like fixing air conditioners in the summer. Third, learning a trade is becoming as popular as learning to code. As more people enter the trades, the industry might struggle to accommodate everyone, but those who get in early will likely enjoy strong demand for their skills.

### Future-Proof Careers

Trade jobs are seen as future-proof because they require skills that machines are far from mastering. Unlike tech jobs, where AI can take over repetitive tasks, trade jobs need human creativity and problem-solving. Even as technology advances, it's hard to imagine robots using tools like wrenches and screwdrivers effectively.

In summary, trade jobs are becoming increasingly attractive due to their stability and the unique skills they require. As AI continues to evolve, these hands-on roles remain crucial and secure. For those looking for a reliable career path, learning a trade might be the perfect choice.
