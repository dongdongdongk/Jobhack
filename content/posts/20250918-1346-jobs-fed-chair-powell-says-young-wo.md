**Why Young Workers Are Struggling to Find Jobs**

Finding a job can be tough, especially for young people just starting their careers. Recently, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted that young workers are having a hard time finding jobs. But it's not just young people facing this challenge; many others are in the same boat. Let's dive into why this is happening and what can be done about it.

**The Job Search Struggle**

One big reason young people struggle to find jobs is that many companies are looking for "unicorns"—candidates with perfect skills who can start immediately and make a big impact. This often means companies set high expectations and aren't willing to train new employees. As a result, young workers, who might not have a lot of experience yet, are often overlooked. To make things worse, many job postings are "ghost jobs," meaning they take hours to apply for but don't actually exist.

**Shifting Career Paths**

Because finding white-collar jobs (like office jobs) has become so difficult, some young workers are turning to blue-collar jobs (like trades or hands-on work). Even highly educated individuals with degrees in fields like computer science are considering these options. This shift happens because these jobs might be more available and can provide stable income, even if they weren't the original career path planned. It’s a practical choice when traditional job opportunities are scarce.

**What Can Be Done?**

To tackle these challenges, both companies and job seekers need to adapt. Companies could lower their expectations and be open to training new employees, while job seekers should focus on gaining skills that are in demand. Networking and connecting with others in the industry can also open doors to job opportunities that might not be advertised. Additionally, keeping an eye out for genuine job postings and avoiding time-consuming ghost applications can save energy and effort.

**Key Takeaways**

Young workers face challenges in the job market due to high employer expectations and ghost jobs. Some are turning to blue-collar work as a viable option. Companies can help by offering training, and job seekers should focus on skill-building and networking. By staying informed and adaptable, young workers can improve their chances of finding meaningful employment.
