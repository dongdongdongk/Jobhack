### Feeling Embarrassed About Where You Work? You're Not Alone

Many people feel embarrassed about their jobs at some point. Whether it's working in a grocery store or being a receptionist, it's normal to sometimes feel like your job doesn’t match up to the high expectations you or others might have. But here's an important reminder: every job matters. The world doesn’t just run because of CEOs, doctors, or lawyers. It runs because of everyone, including those working behind counters, in stores, or on factory floors.

#### The Importance of Every Job

Every job contributes to the world in some way. A lawyer once shared that he believes anyone who works deserves respect, no matter the position. That's a powerful thought because it highlights that all jobs have dignity. Imagine a world without grocery store workers or bartenders. It would be chaotic! Every role supports the bigger picture, keeping our communities running smoothly.

#### Moving Past the Embarrassment

It's easy to feel ashamed when you compare yourself to others. One person felt this way working as a receptionist, especially when old high school classmates saw them at work. Over time, they moved to different jobs and realized that each experience helped them grow. If you're feeling stuck, look for programs that can help you learn new skills. For example, in Michigan, there's a program called Michigan Reconnect that helps adults go back to school.

#### Changing Your Perspective

Sometimes, it takes a conversation to change how you feel about your job. A bartender shared a story where high school friends visited his bar. At first, he was embarrassed, but a friend reminded him that bartending is a skill not everyone has. This shifted his view, helping him appreciate his job more. Remember, your work is valuable, and it's important to see its worth.

In summary, remember that every job is important and deserves respect. If you’re feeling embarrassed, consider how your work contributes to the community. Look for opportunities to grow and change your perspective to see the value in what you do. Every role is a piece of the bigger picture, and that's something to be proud of.
