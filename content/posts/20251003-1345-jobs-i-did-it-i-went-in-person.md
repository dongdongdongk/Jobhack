### I Did It: I Went in Person for a Job

Looking for a job can be tough, especially when you're sending out endless applications online and hearing nothing back. Sometimes, going in person to a workplace can make a big difference. In this article, we’ll explore why taking a step beyond the computer screen could be the key to landing that job. We'll touch on personal stories and simple strategies to help you understand how face-to-face interactions might work better for you.

**Why Go In Person?**

Going in person shows initiative. It demonstrates that you're serious about the job and willing to put in extra effort to get noticed. For instance, one community member shared how they visited their local bookstore every Monday for six weeks, each time asking to speak with the manager about their job application. On their sixth visit, the manager finally met with them, showing that persistence can pay off. This kind of approach can set you apart from other candidates who only apply online.

**The Old-School Way: Making Calls and Showing Up**

Before the internet, many people found jobs by making phone calls or visiting businesses directly. One person recalls opening a phone book, picking an area of interest, and calling every company listed. While this might seem outdated, it can still be effective. By contacting businesses directly, either by phone or in person, you create a more personal connection. When you show genuine interest, you might find opportunities that aren’t advertised online.

**Persistence and Follow-Up**

Persistence is key. Simply showing up once might not work, but consistent follow-ups can make a difference. If you don’t get an immediate answer, ask for the hiring manager’s name and when they’ll be in next. This way, you can follow up at the right time. A little determination can go a long way. One community member encouraged others by saying, "I hope you get it, friend!" showing support for those who choose to persevere.

**Final Thoughts**

In-person job hunting might seem daunting, but it can be a powerful tool. By showing initiative and persistence, you increase your chances of standing out. Remember, a little effort can lead to big opportunities. So, if you're stuck in your job search, consider stepping away from your screen and going out to meet potential employers face-to-face.

In summary, going in person shows dedication and can set you apart from others. Persistence and follow-up are crucial to success. And remember, the old-school methods can still work today.
