### Handling Company Property After Termination

Losing a job can be stressful, but dealing with leftover company property like keys can add another layer of worry. If you find yourself terminated and still holding a company key, you might wonder what to do next. This situation is more common than you might think, and there are straightforward ways to handle it without causing yourself extra hassle.

#### Communication is Key

The first step is to communicate with your former employer. You don't need to go out of your way to return the key. Politely ask them to provide a solution that works for both parties. You could say something like, "Please send me a shipping label or let me know when your courier will pick it up." This way, you make it clear that it's their responsibility to arrange the return.

#### Know Your Worth

Since you are no longer an employee, you have no obligation to deliver the key on your own time or at your own expense. If they want you to come and drop it off, they should compensate you fairly for your time and effort. Let them know that they can either pay your standard rate for you to drive down or arrange for someone to pick it up from your location.

#### Keep It Simple

Some people suggest simply mailing the key back with tracking to ensure it arrives safely. This is a straightforward solution, but make sure you discuss it with your former employer first to confirm they are okay with it. Always keep a record of any communication, just in case you need it later.

#### What Not to Do

While some might jokingly suggest throwing the key away and claiming it was lost, it's better to handle the situation professionally. This ensures you maintain a positive reputation, which is important for your career in the long run.

### Summary

Handling company property after leaving a job doesn't have to be complicated. Communicate with your former employer about how they want the key returned. Ensure they cover any costs involved, and always keep a record of your communications. By handling things professionally, you avoid unnecessary stress and keep your career prospects strong.
