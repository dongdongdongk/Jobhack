**When a $70k Job Offer Turns into a $20/hr Gig: What You Need to Know**

Imagine thinking you're getting a great job with a $70,000 salary, only to find out it's actually a $20 per hour gig. This situation is not just disappointing; it can feel like a trap. In a recent discussion among job seekers, many shared their disbelief and concerns over a similar issue. Let’s break down what happened and what you can learn from it.

**Red Flags to Watch Out For**

The first red flag in this story was the unpaid internship. This is often a sign that something is off, especially if it's not clearly communicated from the start. Many people in the job community expressed that unpaid internships should be carefully evaluated, as they can sometimes lead to false promises. Always ask for clear, written job details before accepting an offer. This includes the payment structure and any conditions like internships.

**The Importance of Clear Communication**

In any job negotiation, clear communication is key. In this case, there was confusion because the job seeker believed they would eventually take over the company. Such big promises can sometimes be misleading. It's crucial to clarify what the job entails and what the future prospects are. If possible, get these details in writing to avoid any misunderstandings later on.

**What to Do if You’re in This Situation**

If you ever face a situation where your job offer changes unexpectedly, know that you're not alone. Start by discussing it with the employer to see if there was a misunderstanding. If things still don't seem right, you might need to look at your legal options, although this can be challenging. Also, seek advice from job communities where others can share their experiences and solutions.

**Key Takeaways**

Unexpected changes in job offers can be frustrating. Always watch for red flags, like unpaid internships, and keep communication clear. If something seems wrong, address it immediately and consider seeking advice from others. Remember, you're not alone, and there are always resources to help you navigate tricky job situations.
