### Where Are the Jobs After Border Security?

The promise of securing the border was often linked to boosting employment opportunities for Americans. But many are asking, "Where are the jobs?" Despite efforts to tighten immigration and secure borders, the expected job boom hasn't materialized for everyone. Instead, some sectors are facing challenges. Let's explore why jobs are still hard to find and what that means for job seekers today.

#### Key Points:

1. **Impact on Agriculture:**
   One of the sectors hit hardest is agriculture. Many believed that reducing immigrant labor would open up jobs for Americans. However, the opposite has happened. For example, China stopped buying U.S. farm products, leading to a tough time for farmers. They are stuck with fewer buyers and have stopped investing in new equipment. This means fewer jobs in farming and related industries.

2. **Wider Economic Challenges:**
   The broader economy hasn't seen the expected boost either. Many people face layoffs, even in high-paying jobs. The belief that immigrants were taking away these jobs doesn't hold up because many of these roles require specific skills. So, even with a secured border, the economy still struggles, and job seekers remain unemployed.

3. **Underlying Issues:**
   Some argue that the focus on immigration and border security was never truly about jobs. Instead, it might have been more about political agendas. This situation reveals that jobs don't just depend on immigration policies but also on broader economic conditions and trade relationships.

### Summary:
The promise that securing the border would lead to more American jobs hasn't fully come true. Agriculture and other sectors are struggling, and many people are still unemployed. It's clear that creating jobs involves more than just immigration policies. Job seekers need to focus on acquiring skills that match the current job market to improve their chances.
