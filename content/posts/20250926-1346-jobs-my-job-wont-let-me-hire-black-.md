### What to Do If Your Job Won’t Let You Hire Black Candidates

Imagine being in a situation where your boss tells you not to hire Black candidates. It’s a tough spot, and you might feel stuck. But you have options to handle it correctly. Here’s a simple guide on what you can do.

#### Record and Report

First, it's important to gather evidence of what’s happening. If you can, record your boss saying this discriminatory policy. Having proof can be very helpful. After you have evidence, report this behavior to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and your state’s labor board. These organizations exist to ensure workplaces are fair and to take action against discrimination.

#### Understand the Impact

Even if your boss allows you to hire Black candidates, consider the work environment. If the boss is racist, new hires might not feel comfortable or valued, leading them to quit eventually. A hostile work environment is not good for anyone, so addressing the root of the problem is essential for long-term change.

#### Seek Legal and HR Advice

For more detailed guidance, consider reaching out to legal or human resources experts. Communities focused on legal advice or HR can offer specific steps and support. They can help you understand your rights and the best ways to proceed.

### Key Takeaways

Facing discrimination at work is difficult, but you have options. Record and report the behavior to the EEOC, consider the impact on potential hires, and seek expert advice. Taking these steps can help ensure fair treatment in the workplace.
