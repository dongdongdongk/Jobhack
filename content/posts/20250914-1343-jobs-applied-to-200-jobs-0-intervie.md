**Struggling to Land an Interview After Applying to 200+ Jobs? Here’s What You Need to Know**

It can be really frustrating to apply for hundreds of jobs and receive no interview calls. This situation is quite common in the job-seeking community, especially for those applying internationally or from non-Western countries. If you are facing this, don’t lose hope! Let’s explore some reasons why this might be happening and what you can do to improve your chances.

**Location and Citizenship Matter**

Companies often prefer candidates who are already in the country where the job is located. If you’re applying from outside, especially from a country like Algeria, it can be challenging. Many employers might automatically reject applications from abroad due to visa and relocation concerns. It’s helpful to focus on companies that are open to international applicants or are known to sponsor visas.

**Work History and Perception Issues**

Your work history can also affect your job search. For instance, if you have experience working with companies like Huawei or other Chinese-focused employers, some Western companies might be hesitant. This is due to concerns over business practices or geopolitical issues. It’s crucial to highlight your skills and achievements in a way that reassures potential employers of your value.

**Crafting the Right Resume**

Your resume is your first impression. It should be tailored to fit the style and expectations of the companies you’re applying to. A well-written resume in a simple, clear format can make a big difference. Focus on showing how your past experiences and skills match the job description.

**Key Takeaways**

If you’re applying for hundreds of jobs but not getting interviews, it might be due to your location, citizenship, or work history. Look for companies open to international hires, tailor your resume to each job, and highlight your skills without focusing on potential red flags. Stay persistent and keep refining your approach.
