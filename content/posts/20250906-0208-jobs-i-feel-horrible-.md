### Feeling Taken Advantage Of? Here’s What to Do

Finding a job can be tough, and sometimes job seekers end up in situations that just don’t feel right. Picture this: you’re at a “working interview” for a job at a gym, and instead of typical job tasks, you’re asked to clean the bathrooms. You leave feeling horrible because it seems like you were just used for free labor. Unfortunately, this kind of situation can happen, but there are ways to handle it. Let's dive into what you can do if you find yourself in a similar situation.

#### Spotting a Possible Scam

Sometimes, companies may try to get free work out of job seekers by disguising it as part of the interview process. In this case, you might be asked to do tasks that are unrelated to the job you applied for, like cleaning bathrooms. This is a red flag. If a company repeatedly does this, it means they don’t have to pay someone to do the job regularly. It’s important to recognize these signs early on so you can avoid being taken advantage of.

#### Know Your Rights

If you find yourself in a situation where you’ve done work during an interview, remember that you have rights. Even if it was just an interview, you should still be compensated for the work you completed. This is a crucial point to remember and can guide your next steps. If a company tries to exploit your time and effort, you can report them to the labor board. This action can help ensure that businesses don’t continue this unfair practice.

#### Taking Action

If you suspect that a company is using interviews to get free work, it’s important to speak up. Share your experience with others in the community so they can watch out for similar scams. Reporting to the labor board not only helps you but also protects future job seekers. Remember, you did nothing wrong, and standing up for your rights is a powerful step towards change.

In summary, always trust your instincts during job interviews. If something feels off, it probably is. Don’t be afraid to ask questions, and if necessary, report unfair practices. Protecting your rights benefits you and the entire community.
